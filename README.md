# 👋 Hello, I am J3ldo  
## About me
I am a 14 year old hobbyist programmer from the Netherlands. I mostly program in Python, HTML, and Javascript but i am also learning C++ and Java. I started out 2 years ago with vbscript and learned that.   After that i decided to program in python and now mostly make my projects in that. 
Some of my favorite projects are [Limited Sniper](https://github.com/J3ldo/LimitedSniper) which is a limited sniper for roblox and Sus-Bot a discord bot which has sadly died.
